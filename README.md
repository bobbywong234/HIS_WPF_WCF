So this is my persoanal project which was developed by WPF under .net core 3.0 </br>
The WCF is the interface which provides the data services that local database's data can be queried via the ADO.net configuration</br>
To access the most acurrate Timestamp data, I use System.net.socket to get the NTP datagram through UDP port from Atomic clock server
